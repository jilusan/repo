         Allison Catmur is a consular officer working at the Embassy of Canada to Italy in Rome.  In addition to providing services to Canadians living in and travelling to Italy, the embassy serves Canadians in Albania, Malta and San Marino.
        </p>
        <p>
        Allison joined Global Affairs Canada in 2008, starting her consular career at the Emergency Watch and Response Center (EWRC) where she worked shifts taking after-hours calls from all over the world. “You never knew what situation you would encounter when you picked up that phone,” she recalls. “I had to work with consular staff at embassies around the world to find solutions for Canadians in need.” This job inspired Allison as it gave her a first glimpse into what the career of a consular officer entails.
        </p>
        <p>
        After working at the EWRC, Allison was posted to Bangkok, Thailand before her current posting in Rome. She feels a lot of pride in her work helping Canadians: “Consular officers in general are very passionate about their jobs. They feel very responsible for helping people.”  She especially loves providing reassurance along with practical assistance when Canadians come to her in a time of need.
        </p>
        <p>
        “When a Canadian comes into our office, it is often because something distressing happened, whether it is a stolen passport, a member of their family hospitalized or even the death of a loved one. Trying to get what you need, particularly in distressing situations, can be confusing! We are here to provide the guidance and support they need.”  
        </p>
        <p>
         For Allison, empathy is a key tool in the work of a consular officer: “It is important to take the time to reassure the person through the process, whether it be filing a police report or getting back home.” She also likes dealing with more complex cases and using skills more traditionally related to diplomacy:  “Part of our role is to advocate for our citizens, for fair treatment, for respect for human rights. It has become really important for consular work in general.” </p>
        <p>Allison advises Canadians planning to visit Italy to think safety first, of course. But she also encourages travellers to seek out enriching encounters with the locals: “Italy is a country where people have a passion for life, food, wine and most of all friendships and family. Canadian visitors, even on shorter trips, should try to connect with people, try to honestly understand the culture and become passionate about what they are passionate about.” For Allison, international travel is really all about the people you meet along the way: “The deep connections you made may be what you remember most from your trip.”</p>
