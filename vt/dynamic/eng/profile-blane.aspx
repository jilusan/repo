           “Many Canadians visit our High Commission in London under difficult circumstances. We do our best to ensure they have the tools they need to help themselves. But sometimes people are vulnerable and we step in to give some extra support. We help them contact family members, show them how to receive money transfers or direct them to local resources where they can get help. Often visitors might come in for one service but end up needing a variety of consular services. We do our best to lay out options while still respecting their autonomy and privacy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sean Blane has been helping Canadians as a consular officer for over 15 years. When he was with Global Affairs Canada’s Family Unit in Ottawa, his work helping abused or neglected children, abducted children and young adults forced into marriage earned him a Public Service Award of Excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
        “Some of my proudest moments as a consular officer have been working to bring children out of bad circumstances into stable situations. This type of work sometimes requires you to go beyond what is expected of your job. But, because you did, a kid may be able to get back to a safe home.”
        </p>
        <p>
         His work in the Family Unit included providing advice to Canada’s embassies and consulates around the world. In light of this experience, and his experience on assignments in the United States, Hungary and the United Kingdom, Sean noted that when Canadians get in trouble far from home, it can be particularly tough on families. 
        </p>
        <p>
         “When a Canadian is arrested in the United Kingdom, we do our best to explain to the family what it is like to be in a prison, the steps involved in the legal process and how to find a lawyer. Many prisons here aren’t easily accessed on public transit so we help family members navigate the city. Many are not familiar with the prison system and end up visiting a jail and being terrified.” 
        </p>
        <p>At any given time, there are 50 to 100 Canadians in jail in the United Kingdom, for anything from overstaying their visa to drug smuggling. As a consular officer, Sean withholds judgment: “There is always humanity to be found in complex consular situations. The warmth consular staff provides to Canadians abroad and their loved ones back home can help in tense situations. Our staff members take their time talking to people and trying to help them understand how the legal system, which is different from Canada’s, works.” </p>
