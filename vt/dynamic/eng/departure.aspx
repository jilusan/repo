<p>Updated: January 27, 2020</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>Original publication date: January 7, 2020</p>

<h2>Current situation</h2>
<p>An outbreak of respiratory illness, first identified in Wuhan, China, has spread to other parts of the country. It is being caused by a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html">novel (new) coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</a>. Many of the initial cases have been linked to the Huanan Seafood Market (also known as Wuhan South China Seafood City and South China Seafood Wholesale Market). The market has been closed as of January 1, 2020, for cleaning and disinfection. The source of the virus is still unknown.</p>

<p>Symptoms have included fever, cough and difficulty breathing. While many of the characteristics of the new coronavirus are still unknown, mild to severe illness has been reported for confirmed cases. Until more is understood about the virus, older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are considered at higher risk of severe disease.</p>

<p>Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed human-to-human transmission has occurred; however, it is unclear how easily the virus is transmitted between people.  There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China at this time. </p>

<p>Some people who travelled to Wuhan have been diagnosed with 2019-nCoV in countries other than China, including Canada, and more cases are expected. A number of  countries and territories have begun screening travellers arriving from Wuhan. Travellers returning to Canada from areas affected by the 2019-nCoV outbreak should be attentive to messages and instructions being provided at Canadian airports. They will be asked about their travel history and may be asked further questions about their health.</p>

<p>Chinese officials in Wuhan as well as other cities in Hubei Province are implementing exceptional measures to reduce further spread of the virus. Given the safety and security risks associated with these measures, the Government of Canada recommends that Canadians <a href="/destinations/china">avoid all travel</a> to Hubei province, China. Verify your travel plans before you depart. </p>

<p>The overall risk of the novel coronavirus to Canadian travellers and to Canada remains low.</p>

<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring the situation and working with the WHO and other international partners to gather additional information. The situation is evolving rapidly.  Please verify travel health recommendations regularly as they may change over the course of your travel as new information becomes available.</p>

<h2>About coronaviruses</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus.html">Coronaviruses</a> are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. Some coronaviruses can cause no or mild illness, like the common cold, but other coronaviruses  can cause severe illness, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).</p>
<p>Some human coronaviruses spread easily between people, while others do not. </p>

<p>There are no specific treatments for illnesses caused by human coronaviruses. Most people with common human coronavirus illnesses will recover on their own.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for travellers</h2>

<p>Chinese New Year officially begins on January 25, 2020. During this time, the number of travellers to China is expected to significantly increase. Spending time in <a href="/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">large</a> crowds or crowded areas can increase your risk of getting sick.</p>
<p>Travellers should take precautions against respiratory and other <a href="/travelling/health-safety/diseases">illnesses</a> while travelling, and seek medical attention if they become sick.</p>

<p><strong>During your trip:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid high-risk areas such as farms, live animal markets, and areas where animals may be slaughtered.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with animals (alive or dead).</li>
	<li>Avoid surfaces with animal droppings or secretions on them.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.</li>
	<li>Avoid eating raw or undercooked animal products.</li>
	<li>Be aware of the local situation and follow local public health advice.  In some areas, access to health care may be affected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Travellers are reminded to follow usual health precautions:</p>

<p><strong>Wash your hands:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html">Wash your hands often</a> with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
	<li>Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available. It’s a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs.</li>
	<li>If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Monitor your health:</strong></p>
<p>If you become sick when you are travelling or after you return, avoid contact with others except to see a health care professional. Tell them:  </p>
<ul>
	<li>your symptoms;</li>
	<li>where you have been travelling or living;</li>
	<li>if you have had direct contact with animals (for example: visited a live animal market) or close contact with a sick person.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel sick during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer.</p>
