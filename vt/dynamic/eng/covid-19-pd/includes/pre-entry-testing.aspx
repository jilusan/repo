<p><strong>Starting April 1, 2022</strong>, pre-entry tests will no longer be required for fully vaccinated travellers entering Canada by land, air or water. Until then, follow the pre-entry test requirements. You must still use ArriveCAN before and after April 1.</p>


<h3>Options for providing proof of a valid pre-entry test</h3>

<p>At this time, all travellers 5 years of age or older entering by land, air or water, must <strong>provide proof of one of the following</strong> accepted types of  test results:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Proof of a professionally administered or observed negative antigen test</strong> taken outside of Canada no more than 1 day before your scheduled flight or entry to Canada by land or water
        <ul>
            <li>the one day window does not depend on the time of day the test was taken or the time of your flight or entry</li>
            <li>for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave or you enter by land any time on Friday, you could provide proof of a negative result from an antigen test taken any time on Thursday, or on Friday</li>
            <li>it must be administered or observed by a pharmacy, laboratory, healthcare entity or telehealth service</li>
            <li>the test must be authorized for sale or distribution in Canada or in the jurisdiction in which it was obtained</li>
            <li>the test must be performed outside of Canada </li>
        </ul>
    </li>    
    <li><strong>Proof of a valid negative molecular test</strong> taken outside of Canada within 72 hours of your scheduled flight’s departure time to Canada or your entry to Canada by land or water
        <ul>
            <li>for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave at 11:00 am on Friday, your test must have been taken any time after 10:59 am on Tuesday</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Previous positive molecular test result:</strong> you no longer have symptoms and provide proof of a positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before entering Canada. Counting starts the day after your test.
        <ul>
            <li>for example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, then January 11 would be the earliest scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada, or the first day you could use it to enter Canada by land or water</li>
            <li>if your positive proof is accepted you won’t have to take arrival or Day-8 tests</li>
            <li>this test can be taken in or outside of Canada</li>
            <li>a positive antigen test result is never a valid test result for boarding a flight or entry to Canada and can’t be used as proof of a previous infection</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

    </summary>

    <p>If you have a connecting flight:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the test must be timed for the scheduled departure time of <strong>your final flight that lands in Canada</strong></li>
        <li>you may need to schedule the test in your transit city or if you’re travelling for longer than 24 hours, you may want to consider taking a molecular test instead of an antigen test.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your proof of a valid negative test result is timed from the initial scheduled departure time of your flight to Canada:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>a negative molecular test</strong> is valid if taken outside of Canada within 72 hours
            <ul>
                <li>for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave at 11:00 am on Friday, your test must have been taken any time after 10:59 am on Tuesday</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed flights</strong>: if your flight is delayed by the airline, your negative COVID-19 molecular test can be used for up to an additional 24 hours (to a maximum of 96 hours) from the scheduled departure time. If the delay causes your test to be more than 96 hours old, you’ll need to be retested.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>a negative antigen test</strong> is valid if taken outside of Canada no more than one day before
            <ul>
                <li>for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave at 11:00 am on Friday, your test must have been taken on the Friday or anytime on Thursday</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed flights</strong>: if your flight is delayed by the airline, your test can be used for up to an additional 24 hours from the scheduled departure time. If the delay causes the test result to be more than 24 hours past the one day limit, you’ll need to be retested.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cancelled flights:</strong> if your flight is cancelled by the airline, there are no extensions to the time limit for your pre-entry test. If your new scheduled flight is not within the time limit for your test, you’ll need to be retested.</p>

    <p>Airlines may refuse boarding to travellers who are unable to provide a valid negative test result or proof of a <strong>previous positive</strong> molecular test result taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before entering Canada.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>for example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, then January 11 would be the earliest scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada, or the first day you could use it to enter Canada by land or water</li>
        <li>if your positive proof is accepted you won’t have to take arrival or Day-8 tests</li>
    </ul>
