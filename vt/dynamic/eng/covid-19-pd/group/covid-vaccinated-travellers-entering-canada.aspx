	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People entering by land</strong> who were unaware of the mandatory use of ArriveCAN will be informed by a Border Services Officer of the mandatory requirements to submit their information through ArriveCAN and will be allowed to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>return to the U.S. to take the time to complete ArriveCAN and re-enter Canada after submitting it or</li>
	<li>complete their ArriveCAN submission at the border crossing, if it is operationally feasible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People arriving by boat (including ferry)</strong> may use ArriveCAN to submit your proof of vaccination within 72 hours of arriving <strong>or when you enter</strong> Canada. Travellers arriving by boat must still provide a pre-entry test within 72 hours of their planned entry into Canada.</p>

<p>Quarantine plan in ArriveCAN</p>

<p>You must be prepared to quarantine when entering Canada as you could be required to quarantine for 14 days if you don’t meet the requirements of a fully vaccinated traveller.</p>

<p>A suitable quarantine plan must be entered into ArriveCAN. You may be asked to explain your quarantine plan at the border.</p>

<p><a href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/isolation/quarantine-start">Assess your quarantine plan</a>If you do not have a suitable place to quarantine</p>

<p>Some travellers may be unable to quarantine at home or their final destination. In these cases, travellers are expected to make alternative arrangements for their entry to Canada. Although alternative accommodations (e.g. with family or friends, or paid accommodation) may be suitable, the Government of Canada does not reimburse for expenses incurred for accommodations, including hotels, RV rentals and trailer park or campground fees.</p>

<p>Make your quarantine plans in advance of your arrival to Canada. Foreign nationals who do not have a suitable plan may be denied entry into Canada. If you do not have a suitable place to quarantine, you may be directed to a federal designated quarantine facility.</p>

<p>Before travellers are directed to a federal designated quarantine facility, government representatives may work with them to confirm that all other options for quarantine accommodations within their own means have been exhausted.</p>

<p>Where required, transportation from the border crossing to a federal designated quarantine and the cost of the facility is provided by the Government of Canada.</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting vaccination issues in ArriveCAN</h3>

<p>You didn’t see the vaccination questions in ArriveCAN or couldn’t upload proof</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you’ve installed the free ArriveCAN mobile app, update it first (if you don’t have auto update on).</li>
	<li>If you don't have a smartphone, <a href="https://arrivecan.cbsa-asfc.cloud-nuage.canada.ca/welcome">sign in to ArriveCAN online</a></li>
	<li>You clicked to the next page without scrolling down after answering all the vaccination questions.</li>
	<li>The vaccine you received is not an accepted vaccine in Canada.</li>
	<li>Your last dose was less than 14 days before entering Canada.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve already submitted your information and have an ArriveCAN receipt without your vaccination information (i.e., without an I or a V next to your name), start over in ArriveCAN before you cross the border. ArriveCAN will clear your previous submission.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/arrivecan.html">Use ArriveCAN – It’s free, download the mobile app or sign in online</a></p>

<p>No receipt from ArriveCAN</p>

<p>If ArriveCAN didn’t ask you to upload proof of vaccination, or showed a message that you are not eligible to enter Canada, there are several possible reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You haven’t updated your free ArriveCAN mobile app. Update it first (if you don’t have auto update on).</li>
	<li>The vaccine you received is not an accepted vaccine.</li>
	<li>Your last dose was less than 14 days before entering Canada.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve already submitted your information and have an ArriveCAN receipt without your vaccination information (for example, without an I or a V next to your name), start over in ArriveCAN before you cross the border. ArriveCAN will clear your previous submission.</p>

<p>Getting emails or calls about quarantine or testing</p>

<p>If you uploaded your proof of vaccination into ArriveCAN and qualified as a fully vaccinated traveller at the border (meaning that you have an A, I, or V next to your name on your ArriveCAN receipt), you should not receive further emails or notifications from ArriveCAN.</p>

<p>If your submission included travellers who are not exempt from the requirement to quarantine (e.g., unvaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds or unvaccinated dependent adults), you will receive ArriveCAN notifications and will be asked to complete daily reporting for the unvaccinated travellers. If you did not have an A, I, or V next to your name on your ArriveCAN receipt, you did not qualify as fully vaccinated and will get post-border notifications.</p>

<p>If you are receiving notifications that don't reflect your situation, use the ArriveCAN contact form so that your situation can be resolved:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/arrivecan/contact-us.html#technical-registration-issues">Contact ArriveCAN form</a></p>

<p>Your ArriveCAN receipt doesn’t include the letters I, V, or A</p>

<p>You may see one or more letters beside your name on your receipt. This means that you may have to discuss one of the following with a Government official at the border:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(Q) your quarantine plan</li>
	<li>(S) your symptom self-assessment</li>
	<li>(V) or (I) your vaccination status (ensure you have evidence of your proof of vaccination when you travel and be prepared to show it on arrival)</li>
</ul>

<p>If there’s no letter I, V, or A next to your name</p>

<ul>
	<li>you aren’t fully vaccinated according to Canada’s requirements, or</li>
	<li>you didn’t upload proof of vaccination (1 image for your one-dose vaccine, 2 images for your two-dose vaccine, or 1 image that includes details of both of your doses)</li>
	<li>you’re travelling for exempt essential travel</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve already submitted your information and have an ArriveCAN receipt without your vaccination information (for example, without an I, V or A next to your name), start over in ArriveCAN before you cross the border. ArriveCAN will clear your previous submission.</p>

<h2 id="arrival">Arrival tests</h2>

<p>Upon your entry to Canada by air or at a land border crossing, the border services officer may notify you that you’ve been randomly selected for a mandatory arrival test.</p>

<p>As a fully vaccinated traveller, you can travel to your destination, including on connecting flights, without waiting for your arrival test results (if selected for testing).</p>

<p>Who must take an arrival test if selected to do so upon arrival</p>

<p>Fully vaccinated travellers are <strong>not exempt</strong> from mandatory randomized arrival testing.</p>

<p>Requirements for children aged 5 to 11 accompanying fully vaccinated parents (and other eligible adults):</p>

<ul>
	<li>unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children must be tested if their accompanying parent is selected for mandatory randomized testing</li>
	<li>children who qualify as fully vaccinated are not required to be tested if their accompanying parent is selected for mandatory randomized testing</li>
	<li>children who qualify as fully vaccinated must be tested if they are selected for mandatory randomized testing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="arrival-test-exceptions">Who is exempt from arrival testing</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Already recovered:</strong> Travellers who provide a positive COVID-19 molecular test result, conducted at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before entering Canada. Counting starts the day after the test is taken.

	<ul>
