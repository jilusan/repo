<p>COVID-19 continues to circulate in Canada and internationally. The virus can spread easily between people in close quarters, such as on cruise ships. The chance of being infected with COVID-19 on cruise ships is very high, even if you’re fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>If you decide to take a cruise outside of Canada, there are some important facts you should consider.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>If you aren’t fully vaccinated, or if you’re at higher risk for developing <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#people">severe disease</a> or outcomes from COVID-19, you should avoid cruise ship travel. </strong></li>
    <li>Get vaccinated. Complete your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines.html">COVID-19 vaccine series</a> along with any additional recommended doses, in Canada, at least 14 days before your cruise begins. </li>
    <li>Check the COVID-19 testing and vaccination requirements and other entry requirements for your shore leave locations, as well as the entry requirements for returning to Canada.</li>
    <li>Consider selecting only cruises and excursions that require proof of vaccination.</li>
    <li>Regardless of your vaccination status, consistently follow <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p">individual public health measures</a> such as wearing a mask and physical distancing, even if it’s not required. </li> 
</ul>

<!-- Outbreaks -->
<h3 id="outbreaks">Outbreaks</h3>

<p><strong>Keep in mind that if an outbreak of COVID-19 or other contagious illness occurs during your cruise:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>you could be subject to quarantine procedures onboard the ship or in a foreign country</li>
    <li>the range of consular services available on cruise ships may be significantly restricted by local authorities, especially in quarantine situations</li>
    <li>the cost of medical care could be very expensive, and you may need to pay medical bills immediately in cash</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government of Canada won’t pay your medical bills, including COVID-19 related expenses or medical evacuation.</p>
<p>If you’re infected with COVID-19, review the <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/exemptions">entry requirements and exemptions</a> before returning to Canada. You shouldn’t depend on the Government of Canada for assistance to change your travel plans.</p>
