           France is one of the top international tourist destinations. As France is rich in history, museums, castles and vineyards, it is not surprising that Canadians make over a million trips to France every year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, over 1,500 Canadians used the services of the Embassy of Canada in Paris. Geneviève Kidd Bouchard has worked at the embassy for 12 years as a consular officer and is very familiar with the challenges Canadians face in France.
        </p>
        <p>
        “There are many Canadian residents here. The administrative procedures here are different from those in Canada, and we help people navigate them by providing information on passports, citizenship, notarial acts for marriages or civil unions and other official documents.” 
        </p>
        <p>
         Some people reach out to the Embassy for bigger problems.  
        </p>
        <p>
         “In the past, we have helped destitute Canadians who were living on the streets in France or Canadians who, following an accident, were seriously injured. In those cases, we support them in reconnecting with their family and preparing for their return to Canada. Some people were so destitute and disoriented that they would probably not have been able to get back home without our help. It makes us feel useful when we manage to help people get out of tough situations.” 
        </p>
        <p>During the summer, numerous tourists are the victims of theft in the big cities and tourist destinations of France. </p>
        <p>
        “When that happens to a Canadian, I do my best to be there for them, listen to them and help them manage their stress. Whether or not the theft was violent, it’s often very difficult for the victim. Victims have to report the theft right away, ensure they have access to money and replace important documents, like their passports. I help them go through the necessary steps and give them the information they need to resolve the problem.” 
        </p>
