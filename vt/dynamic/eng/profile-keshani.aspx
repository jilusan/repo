         Arif Keshani, Consul General at the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, has been working at Global Affairs Canada since 1999.  His master’s degree in International Law helps him deal with the legal aspects of consular and diplomatic affairs. His knowledge of Japanese, learned during his many years in Japan, gives him an opportunity to better understand the culture and work very effectively with local authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arif’s parents chose to immigrate to Canada, which reinforces the pride he feels in representing Canada abroad and helping Canadians when they are far from home. “In my role, I have the good fortune to meet Canadians from all walks of life, and it’s clear to me that Canada’s strength lies in its diversity.”    
        </p>
        <p>
        Record numbers of Canadians are travelling and living overseas, and most have great experiences, but when they need help, a consular official is there to provide support and is often their connection back to Canada.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Approximately 10,000 Canadians call Japan home and more than 300,000 Canadians visit Japan every year.  “Our embassy in Tokyo helps support Canadians in many ways, from replacing lost passports to prison visits.  I personally get involved in complex cases, such as international child abduction, detention cases and managing large scale emergencies. In a country like Japan that is vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons, we at the embassy spend time planning so that we are better prepared to support Canadians if an emergency were to occur.” 
        </p>
        <p>
         Arif advises that when Canadians have legal problems abroad, “We can’t change the laws of a country or obtain special treatment, however, in Japan we help Canadians navigate local challenges, complicated by language barriers, and also advocate on their behalf for fair treatment.  Some of my interventions with Japanese authorities are quick and some require longer term engagement, including leveraging local Japanese networks, through which I advocate for the safety, protection and well-being of Canadians in Japan. </p>
        <p>“Above all else, nothing is more rewarding than helping a Canadian who is faced with a problem to return safely to his or her family in Canada.</p>
        <p>“Japanese culture and hospitality, “omotenashi”, are world renowned, making a visit to Japan a very unique experience.  Taking an opportunity to learn the differences in rules and expectations when travelling to Japan will help contribute to a very rewarding trip.”</p>
