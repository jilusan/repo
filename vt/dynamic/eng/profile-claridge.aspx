           Robin Claridge is First Secretary and Consul in Bridgetown, Barbados. She has been a consular officer for 20 years now, but still appreciates the new challenges she faces every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The High Commission of Canada in Barbados covers a vast territory. The first challenge for the consular officers who work there is providing consular assistance to a dozen neighbouring islands, from Grenada all the way to the British Virgin Islands. “Sometimes, there is no other way to get to these isolated islands than by plane,” she says. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The second challenge is weather-related, and the Canadian government office prepares for hurricane season every year. “The eastern Caribbean region is right in the hurricane belt,” Robin reminds us, “and because Canada isn’t really directly affected by hurricanes, Canadians aren’t always fully aware of the threat. However, here, it’s our reality. We go on hurricane watch mode every year and the storms seem to be getting worse and worse.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Robin remembers the particular challenges in 2017, when several islands in the Eastern Caribbean were hit by Hurricanes Irma and Maria: “When a major hurricane touches down it causes significant damage and the airports are often affected as well. When this happened in the past, it greatly limited our means of getting to the more isolated areas.” The consular team helped Canadians in many ways by setting up meeting places across the large territory, facilitating their departure when possible, and issuing emergency travel documents to help them get back home. “No matter the obstacles, our main objective is always to help Canadians,” states Robin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Robin recommends that you carefully plan your visit to the Caribbean. Take the time to read the Travel Advice and Advisories for your destination(s), as they contain useful information about safety and security conditions abroad and are updated promptly to respond to events that may affect Canadians. She also urges all Canadian travellers to sign up for the Registration of Canadians Abroad service: “When Canadians are registered, they immediately receive important information before or during a hurricane. It’s been very helpful in notifying Canadians if a hurricane is coming, telling them if an evacuation is needed once it passes, and where this evacuation will take place.”
